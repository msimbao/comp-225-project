<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

### Overview:

![Image 1](images/system/2.png)

Tympdeja is a super minimalist news platform. We bring together latest major league sports content that matters most to a user without them having to go to multiple sites and also being able to have access to a huge amount of content all in one place.

### Features:

1. A Minimalist Feed
We cut through the clutter, remove social media, have no ads and paid distractions and do not record your personal data.
2. Privacy
We never collect any personal data, only user emails, passwords and team choices.
3. Multiple Sources
We bring a large amount of articles from different authors and sources for a user to read.

### Product Vision:
* To make it easier to get articles about a sports team(s) in one place
* It allows fans to have their news in a single place
* It will present links to certain articles based on preferences for a certain sports team
### Audience: 
* Sports fans
* Release unknown
### Risks:
* Not knowing how to scrape articles onto the webpage. We eventually dropped a lot of the code for scraping and switched to an api.
* Difficult to get access to certain APIs
* We donâ€™t know what languages we are going to use

### Display
* Shows a preview of the article
* General feed
* Individual team display

### Built With

![Image 2](images/system/3.png)

The system is a simple app built with flask (Python) hosted on Heroku and Vue (Javascript) and hosted on glitch. Firebase stands as the main database for storing user preferences and news data. The news data is taken from the Bing News Api on the Microsoft Azure platform. News is taken from the Api daily and saved to firebase where the client app can access it from.

* [Vue JS](https://vuejs.org/)
* [Flask](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/1.1.x/)
* [Firebase](https://firebase.google.com/)
* [Heroku](https://www.heroku.com/)
* [Bing News Api](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/bing/apis/bing-news-search-api)

<!-- GETTING STARTED -->
## Getting Started

This is an example of how you may give instructions on setting up your project locally.
To get a local copy up and running follow these simple example steps.

### Prerequisites

All modules are listed in the requirements.txt file and can be installed using pip. This step is included in the running section as well.

  ```sh
  pip install -r requirments.txt
  ```

NOTE: These are all python3 modules and some have specific versions so make sure you are using python3 to run this app.

  
### Running

1. Clone the repo
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/msimbao/comp-225-project.git
   ```
2. Change your directory to the project directory
   ```sh
   cd comp-225-project
   ```
3. Install python3 packages

  ```sh
  pip install -r requirments.txt
  ```

4. Run app.py
   ```sh
   python3 app.py
   ```
5. Check the port that flask is running on in your terminal (last line in terminal). It should be http://127.0.0.1:5000/ by default.
   ```sh
   #Last line in Terminal tells you the port it is running on
   
   * Running on http://127.0.0.1:5000/ (Press CTRL+C to quit)
   ```

6. If the last line looks like that above (localhost port=5000), then click this link to launch the webapp: [http://127.0.0.1:5000/](http://127.0.0.1:5000/)

7. If the last line does not go to port=5000, then open the client.js file and change the beginning parts of the flask routes from http://127.0.0.1:5000/ to whatever your terminal gives you.
